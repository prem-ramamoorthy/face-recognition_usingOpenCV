# Face Recognition using OpenCV

This project demonstrates face detection and recognition using OpenCV in Python. It captures faces from a webcam, trains a recognizer, and identifies faces in real time.

##  Features

- Face detection using Haar Cascades
- Face recognition using LBPHFaceRecognizer
- Real-time face recognition using a webcam
- Dataset creation and model training
- Lightweight and easy to use

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Haar Cascades (for face detection)
